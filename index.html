                  <h1>Biography</h1>
                  <p>
                        Steve Jobs, born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, was an American
                        entrepreneur, inventor, and co-founder of Apple Inc. He is widely regarded as one of the most
                        influential figures in the technology industry and played a pivotal role in shaping the modern
                        world through his innovations and visionary leadership.
                        From a young age, Jobs showed a keen interest in electronics and technology. Growing up in
                        Mountain View, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley, he was exposed to the burgeoning tech
                        scene and quickly became fascinated by the possibilities of computing.<br><br>
                        In 1976, along with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Jobs co-founded Apple Computer, later
                        renamed Apple Inc. Their first product, the Apple I computer, laid the foundation for the
                        company's success. The introduction of the Apple II further solidified Apple's position in the
                        emerging personal computer market.<br><br>
                        However, internal conflicts and power struggles within the company led to Jobs' departure from
                        Apple in 1985. Undeterred, he went on to found NeXT Computer and later acquired Pixar Animation
                        Studios, where he played a pivotal role in the creation of groundbreaking animated films.
                        In 1996, Apple acquired NeXT Computer, bringing Steve Jobs back to the company he co-founded.
                        His return marked the beginning of a new era of innovation and resurgence for Apple. Under his
                        leadership, Apple introduced a series of iconic products, including the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and
                        iPad, revolutionizing industries and reshaping consumer technology.
                        Despite facing health challenges, Jobs continued to lead Apple with passion and determination.
                        His unwavering commitment to excellence and his ability to anticipate and meet consumer needs
                        cemented his legacy as one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the modern era.<br><br>
                        Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, leaving behind a profound legacy of innovation,
                        creativity, and entrepreneurship. His vision and leadership continue to inspire generations of
                        innovators and entrepreneurs around the world, ensuring that his impact on technology and
                        society will be felt for years to come.</p>
